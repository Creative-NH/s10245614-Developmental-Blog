NOTE: I mistakenly believed the GitHub blog was not working and thus did not submit the blog posts I have made thus far. (Week 2-9)

This was one of the most important lessons in the module thus far, due to its introduction to Event Handling, a means of responding to events that occur in a website, mainly user input in the form of clicking, mouseover or data.
The key use of Event Handling is in Validation, the process of ensuring user input is appropriate, where an event listener for the submit button is used to check user input and accept or reject it accordingly.
This lesson also touches on JSON, a method of storing data locally, enabling the browser to “remember” user input.
