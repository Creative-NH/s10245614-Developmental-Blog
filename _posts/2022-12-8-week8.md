title: "Week 8 â€“ jQuery and Application Programming Interfaces"

NOTE: I mistakenly believed the GitHub blog was not working and thus did not submit the blog posts I have made thus far. (Week 2-9)

jQuery, a JavaScript library that provides a convenient alternative to query selectors, was introduced in this lesson. It provides users with faster, time-saving methods of executing frequently performed actions, such as selecting elements in the DOM, changing the CSS of an element or handling events. This lesson also touches on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). They serve as an intermediary between a client and the server, sending client requests and receiving server data in a non-intrusive manner. This shortens wait times and enables pages to load new data without having to be refreshed, resulting in a massively improved user experience.
